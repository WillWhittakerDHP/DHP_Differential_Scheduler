# Plan: session 20.5.2 — Baseline placement & event routing

## Contract
- **Tier:** session | **ID:** 20.5.2
- **Scope:** Close **DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md** “**Gaps for session 20.5.2**” by documenting **fresh vs upgraded** baseline data, **placement** seeds (**061**), relational **`event_assignments`** framing, and **§9.6** mitigation prose (**orchestrator baseline** ≠ implicit ORM default).
- **Governance (harness snapshot):**

## Work Profile
- **Execution intent:** plan
- **Action type:** decomposition
- **Scope shape:** cross_cutting
- **Governance domains:** docs, architecture, booking
- **Gate profile:** standard
- **Suggested depth:** full — advisory; agent decides in Analysis / Decomposition
- **Recommended context pack:** decomposition_pack
- **Planning artifact action:** create
- **Decomposition mode:** moderate
- **Downstream advice:** Planning doc is advisory; guide owns current-tier decomposition.

## Where we left off
Session **20.5.1** shipped **Checkpoint 9** + **§9.5 crosswalk** in **`DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md`**, with explicit **`gap:`** bullets deferred to **20.5.2** (orchestrator baseline, seeders, fresh vs upgraded).

## Story
**This session delivers** written **baseline placement + event routing** expectations for **new and upgraded** databases **so that** **§8.5** / **§9.6** are not satisfied only by migrations list — operators know what **configuration rows** legitimately establish routing vs what **admin/product** must create.
**Estimated size:** S (documentation only; **no** Sequelize seeders directory exists in repo today).

---
## Architecture context (harness-injected)

## 1. System overview

Bonsai Differential Scheduler is a **Vue 3 + Express + Sequelize** application with a **shared type layer** (`shared/` / `@shared`). It serves:

- **Public booking users** — wizard-style scheduling and property/availability flows.
- **Admin configurators** — metadata-driven entity CRUD, wizard settings, availability rules, integrations.

TanStack **Vue Query** manages server-state caching. Composables typically expose **`ComputedRef<T>`** for read-only query data. Admin metadata is often batch-prefetched (e.g. router navigation guards).

---

## 2. Domain map

| Domain | Client paths | Server paths | Key models / areas | Shared types |
|--------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Booking / Wizard** | `client/src/composables/booking/`, `useBooking.ts`, `useAppointment.ts`, `useProperty.ts`, `components/booking/`, `views/booking/`, `types/booking/`, `configs/wizardSteps`, `configs/availabilitySettings` | `server/src/routes/internal/appointments`, `availability`, `properties`, `services/availability*`, `db/models` booking-related | Appointments, selections, time slots, properties, fees | `@shared/types` availability, appointment-related |
| **Admin / Config** | `composables/admin/`, `components/admin/`, `views/admin/`, `types/admin/`, `configs/` | `routes/internal/entities`, `relationships`, `admin-metadata`, `*-settings`, `db/models` admin | Shapes, instances, wizard settings, calendar settings, business rules | `@shared/types/entities` |
| **Auth / Sessions** | Router guards; future `composables/auth/` | `routes/internal/auth`, `auth/`, `db/models/auth` | Sessions, users, magic links (evolving); **`users.user_role`** (ENUM + API) | Auth contracts in `@shared` as they stabilize; **canonical role strings** via `@shared` (`USER_ROLE_VALUES` — Feature 6 Session 6.18.1) |
| **Integrations** | `services/calendarApiService`, `mapsApiService`, `propertyEnrichmentApiService` (full-URL axios) | `routes/external/calendar`, `oauth`, `maps`, `services/google/` | OAuth, external APIs | `@shared/types/calendar` |
| **Beta** | `composables/beta/`, `views/beta/`, `components/beta/` | `routes/internal/beta-feedback`, `db/models/beta` | Beta feedback | (often local types) |

---

## 3. Data flow

Canonical path:

1. **Vue view** → **presentational component**
2. **Composable** (state + orchestration; thin components)
3. **Client HTTP**
   - **Default:** `utils/api/apiClient` — relative paths, same-origin API.
   - **Integrations:** `services/*ApiService` — full-base-URL axios (calendar, maps, enrichment).
4. **Express route** (`routes/internal/*` or `routes/external/*`)
5. **Service** (`server/src/services/`)
6. **Repository** (`server/src/repositories/`) or direct Sequelize access
7. **Sequelize model** (`server/src/db/models/`)

Cross-cutting: **transformers** (e.g. global → booking), **injection keys** for wizard scope, **TanStack Query** keys + invalidation for mutations.

**Booking resolution boundary:** The server serves **configuration and raw storage rows** (e.g. part instances, relationships) plus appointment-scoped inputs such as `property_details`. **PartFinalizer** on the **client** resolves wizard time, fee, and segment placement for the live booking flow. On submit, the client sends a **full appointment payload**; the server **persists** it and does **not** re-run PartFinalizer to recompute or “verify” those totals. Do not introduce a second booking calculator on the server for the same contract (see §10).

---

## 4. Type boundaries

| Layer | Location | Use when |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Shared contracts** | Repo `shared/`, imported as `@shared/types/...` | Types needed by **both** client and server (API shapes, branded IDs, shared enums). |
| **Client-only** | `client/src/types/<domain>/` | UI-only: injection keys, wizard step types, transformer helpers, form field types. **Never** imported by server. |
| **Server-only** | `server/src/types/` | Handler params, repository types, internal DTOs. **Never** imported by client. |

**Rule:** If both sides need it → `@shared`. If only one side → keep it local.

**Reactivity boundaries:** Prefer `ComputedRef<T>` for read-only consumer APIs; `Ref<T>` for internal mutable state; avoid leaking `Ref | ComputedRef` unions at public composable boundaries (see type governance rule + TYPE_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK).

---

## 5. Per-domain conventions

### Booking / wizard

- **Composable prefixes:** `useBooking*`, `useAvailability*`, `useWizard*`, `useAppointment*`, `useProperty*` (orchestrators such as `useAvailabilityOrchestrator`, `useBookingWizardSetup`).
- **Components:** under `components/booking/` (steps in `components/booking/steps/`).
- **Depends on** admin metadata (wizard blocks, availability rules) — document cross-domain deps in planning **Analysis**.
- **Scheduling rules:** Block instances, part ledger, PartFinalizer, event placement, and invariants are defined in **§8–§14** below.

### Admin

- **Prefixes:** `useAdmin*`, `useEntity*`, entity CRUD around `EntityBase<GlobalEntityKey>` + `ENTITY_CONFIGS`.
- **Pattern:** Generic admin components + config objects + transformers.
- **Shape vs instance:** Structural validity (`valid_*` relationships) is edited on the **shapes** side; orchestration editors **select** active assignments from that universe — they do not redefine structural possibility (see §9).

### Auth

- **Emerging domain;** keep route and model changes aligned with `routes/internal/auth` and `db/models/auth`. Consumed by all domains via middleware/guards over time.

### Users / `user_role`

- **`users.user_role`** is a **small closed set** (PostgreSQL ENUM + Joi + client types). **Delivered (Feature 6 Session 6.18.1):** **`@shared`** exports **`USER_ROLE_VALUES`** and per-role constants; server and client **import** that list. Product vocabulary uses **`owner`** (not `seller`) end-to-end, including wizard **`additionalContacts[].role`** and contact-step field names (`ownerInfo`, `showOwner`). **Note:** Older saved wizard or step snapshots that used `seller` / `sellerInfo` are not migrated client-side; users re-enter contacts or clear stored state if needed.
- **User-type block instances** (state-control shapes) drive scheduling/display semantics; **`getUserTypeBlockIdForRole`** maps **DB role** → block instance. **Session 6.18.2** adds **admin-persisted alignment** (role → `block_instance_id`) so mappings are configurable without code edits where product allows. See `features/appointment-workflow/phases/phase-6.18-guide.md`.
- **Feature 7 Enactment** exposes role to the client using the **same** shared vocabulary as the API.

### Integrations

- Prefer **dedicated services** and **external routes**; avoid mixing full-URL axios into `apiClient` call sites without reason.

### Beta

- Isolated feedback capture; keep `beta` paths grouped under composables/views/components/beta.

## (from ARCHITECTURE.md — domain rules §8+)

## 8. Domain model (block shape types)

The system has five block shape **types**. Each owns one scheduling concern. All five participate in the three-property instance model (§9).

| Type | Domain | What it owns |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `user` | Identity | User identity and wizard state. User instances drive cascades and annotations. |
| `service` | Structure | Work items (part instances), active downstream assignments per service context. **Base** time/fee defaults and floors live only on **service orchestrator** part instances. |
| `event` | Event | Part-instance calendar segment assignments and time-axis patterns. |
| `time` | Duration | Part-instance duration contributions from property characteristics (rates × inputs). |
| `price` | Fee | Part-instance fee contributions and rollups from rates and cascades. |

**Domain separation:** Each domain writes only its own concern on part instances. Domains **compose**; they do not overwrite each other’s values.

**Legacy names:** During migrations, stored enums or code may still reference older labels (`property` / `coupon` / `option`); target names are **`time`**, **`price`**, **`event`** aligned to this table.

---

## 9. Block instances: three-property model and layering

### 9.1 Three orthogonal properties (instance storage only)

Every **block instance** has three independent booleans (not on block **shapes**):

| Property | Axis | Question |
|----------|------|----------|
| `orchestrator` | Behavior | Root of an active assignment graph across other shapes? |
| `composite` | Structure | Owns child block instances of the **same** shape? |
| `wizardVisible` | Presentation | Appears in the booking wizard when cascades permit? |

Any combination is valid. Compositeness is **same-shape** hierarchy; orchestration is **cross-shape** active selection from the shape-level validity graph.

### 9.2 Layering

```
Block shape (template — type, domain, valid shape-level relationships)
  └─ Block instance (runtime — carries composite / orchestrator / wizardVisible)
       └─ Part instance (value ledger per block instance)
```

- **Shapes** define what is structurally possible (`valid_*` tables). They do **not** store the three booleans.
- **Block instances** store the three booleans and create part instances.
- **Orchestrator instances** choose which downstream instances are **active** from the options the shape graph allows — they do **not** redefine validity.

---

## 10. Part instances, PartFinalizer, and resolution

### 10.1 Per-block-instance ledger

Each block instance owns its own part instances via `part_assignments` (including user block instances). No instance writes another instance’s part rows.

**Two resolution tiers on part rows:**

| Tier | Who | Columns |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Base** | Service orchestrator only | `baseTime`, `baseFee` (floor + starting values) |
| **PerUnit** | Time / price atomics | `timePerUnit`, `feePerUnit` |

**Events:** Routed via relational **`event_assignments`** (event instance ↔ part instance), not scalar default/override columns on part instances.

### 10.2 PartFinalizer (client)

Part instances are storage. **PartFinalizer** (booking client pipeline) aggregates:

- `resolvedTime` = service base + Σ(timePerUnit × input) for time atomics in the same **lineage** bucket.
- `resolvedFee` = service base + Σ(feePerUnit × input) and percentage passes.
- `resolvedEvent` = event profile override **else** event orchestrator baseline assignment **per part instance**.

Base acts as a **floor** until zero-out. **Correlation:** bucket by lineage to the atomic service / line item — **forbidden** to resolve by `part_shape` alone when multiple work items could collide.

### 10.3 Resolution order (per part)

1. Per-block-instance part records exist.  
2. Resolve part-level time (base + time atomics using `property_details` inputs).  
3. Resolve part-level fee (base + price atomics).  
4. Resolve part-level event assignment (override ?? baselin

## Codebase recon (agent-led — required)
Injected docs above are not a substitute for opening real code. Search/read `client/`, `server/`, and `shared/` as relevant to this tier.

- **Paths reviewed:** `DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md` (**#### Gaps for session 20.5.2**, §9.5 crosswalk); `FEATURE_20_ARCHITECTURE_REDESIGN.md` **§1.2** (event routing row), **§5.2** (server constraints), **§9.6** risk table; `server/src/db/migrations/20260432_000061_event_schema_placement_instance_attendees.mjs` (placement seeds in header/body); repo-wide glob **`**/seeders/**`** → **no** `server/src/db/seeders` (baseline is **migrations + admin-created config**, not checked-in seed scripts).
- **Patterns:** **Baseline routing** in product terms = **`valid_*` cascades** + **`event_assignments`** edges from **event instances** to **part instances**, selected by **orchestrators** per shape graph — not a hidden column default on parts (**FEATURE_20** §1.2, §5.1). **061** seeds **named placement-type** `event_shapes` rows only; it does **not** fabricate full production orchestration graphs.
- **Gaps / unknowns:** Whether a future **seeder** is desired for demo tenants — **out of scope** unless phase adds a task; this session **documents current reality**.

## Analysis
- **Why now:** **20.5.1.2** left **`gap:`** for orchestrator baseline; **§9.6** requires explicit mitigation language.
- **Boundaries:** **`.project-manager/analysis/`** only; cite **migrations** by id, do not change them.
- **Risks:** Claiming migrations insert full routing graphs — **avoid**; state **admin + validity graph** responsibility clearly.

## Goal
1. Append **`### Baseline placement & event routing (session 20.5.2)`** to **`DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md`** with: **Fresh DB after full `20260432` migrate**, **Upgraded DB**, **Placement-type seeds (061)**, **Relational routing (`event_assignments`)**, **Orchestrator baseline vs profile override** (align **FEATURE_20** §1.2 / §5.x vocabulary).
2. Replace or annotate **`#### Gaps for session 20.5.2`** so items are **resolved in prose** (or marked **N/A** with reason — e.g. no seeders dir).
3. Add **§9.6 mitigation** paragraph: implicit default routing is avoided by documenting that **no** server path invents `event_assignments`; baseline comes from **stored graph + admin selections**, with **061** only guaranteeing **placement catalog** seeds.

## Files
- **Read:** `FEATURE_20_ARCHITECTURE_REDESIGN.md` (§1.2, §5.2, §9.6), `DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md` (Checkpoint 9 + crosswalk + gaps)
- **Write:** `DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md` only

## Approach
1. **Task 20.5.2.1:** Draft the **Baseline placement & event routing** section (subsections per **Goal**).
2. **Task 20.5.2.2:** Add **§9.6 explicit mitigation**; update **Gaps for session 20.5.2** block to **“Addressed (20.5.2)”** with pointers to subsection anchors; optional one-line **seeders: none in repo**.
3. **§9.1** skim after edits (orchestrator = selector language only).

## Checkpoint
- **`/accepted-plan`** → **`/task-start 20.5.2.1`** → **`/accepted-code`** → implement → **`/task-end`** → **`/task-start 20.5.2.2`** → repeat → **`/session-end 20.5.2`**.

## Deliverables
- Updated **`DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md`** with new section + closed/annotated gaps + §9.6 mitigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Fresh** and **upgraded** DB expectations each have a short subsection.
- [ ] **061** placement seeds described; no false claim that migrations seed all **`event_assignments`**.
- [ ] **`event_assignments`** + **orchestrator baseline** language matches **FEATURE_20** (no scalar part event columns).
- [ ] **Seeders:** explicit statement (**none** under `server/src/db/seeders` today) or list if found.
- [ ] **§9.6** mitigation paragraph present.
- [ ] Edits confined to **`DOMAIN_REWRITE_WORKLOG.md`**.

## Decomposition
- **Task 20.5.2.1:** **Baseline narrative** — add **`### Baseline placement & event routing (session 20.5.2)`** with Fresh / Upgraded / Placement seeds / Relational routing / Orchestrator baseline subsections.
- **Task 20.5.2.2:** **§9.6 mitigation + gaps closure** — paragraph tying **§9.6** table to documented behavior; retitle or replace **`#### Gaps for session 20.5.2`** with **addressed** summary + pointers; note **no Sequelize seeders** in repo.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] App starts (`npm run start:dev`)
- [ ] Lint passes (`cd client && npm run lint`, `cd server && npm run lint`)
- [ ] Governance score maintained or improved
- [ ] All child tasks complete
- [ ] Session log and handoff updated
